- active validator set vs entry queue and exit queue
- full lifecycle of a validator
    - set stake -> pending validator set -> active validator -> exit queue -> exitted
- how the exit process works
    - 2 phase exit
        - active validator -> exit queue -> withdrawable period -> withdrawable sweep

    - native staking
        - stake / block rewards in beacon chain
    - liquid staking (LST - liquid staking token)
        - via 3rd party (lido, coinbase, rocketpool)
